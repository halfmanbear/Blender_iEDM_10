# EDM model files – Blender Import Addon

Designed to work with Blender 4.5 LTS: https://www.blender.org/download/releases/4-5/

Designed to work in conjunction with the official Eagle Dynamics  
`io_scene_edm` (exporter) plugin for Blender version 259871:  
https://mods.eagle.ru/blender_plugin/io_scene_edm-259871.zip
Press `n` in blender to access the official `EDM Export` Sidebar tab where you can access the Object Properties menu.

This is a **HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL**, totally **UNOFFICIAL** Blender addon to import  
`.EDM` model files as used by the flight simulator **DCS World**.

The importer has been developed through careful study of the EDM binary format,  
comparison against reference `.blend` outputs generated via the official exporter,  
reverse-engineering of exporter-side behavior, and extensive automated testing.

While the EDM file format is now largely understood, the translation of EDM scene  
semantics into Blender is still under active development and refinement.  
Some behaviors exhibited by the official exporter and the resulting reference `.blend` files  
rely on internal heuristics and exporter-side knowledge that are **not fully encoded in the EDM v10 format itself**  
(e.g. original mesh naming).

## Legal & Usage Disclaimer

This project is an **unofficial, third-party importer** for `.EDM` files used by **DCS World** and is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Eagle Dynamics** in any way.

All `.EDM` files, models, textures, and related assets from DCS World remain the  
**intellectual property of Eagle Dynamics and/or their respective rights holders** and are subject to the DCS World End User License Agreement (EULA).

This tool is intended solely for:

- Personal, private use  
- Mod development and technical research for DCS World  
- **Preservation, maintenance, and future-proofing of player-created mods and user files** (including community-created content that may otherwise become unusable in future DCS releases)  
- Diagnostics, debugging, and learning purposes  

**You may not use this tool or any extracted assets for:**

- Commercial purposes  
- Redistribution of proprietary Eagle Dynamics assets  
- Use in other games, engines, films, media, or artwork  
- Any activity that violates the DCS World EULA or applicable copyright law  

There is currently **no official `.EDM` importer provided by Eagle Dynamics**.  
This project exists to support modding workflows, long-term preservation of community-created content, and technical understanding of the format, but it cannot grant any rights to use or redistribute proprietary content.

If you are creating mods for DCS World, you are responsible for ensuring that your usage complies with Eagle Dynamics’ terms and the permissions of any third-party asset creators.

When in doubt: **do not extract, convert, or reuse assets you do not have explicit permission to use.**

## What Works

- Parsing and reading raw data from EDM v10 files  
- Importing visual geometry 
- Importing full object hierarchies (empties, armatures, mesh parenting)  
- Accurate reconstruction of:
  - World and local transforms (location, rotation, scale)
  - Animation controller nodes (rotation, translation, scale, visibility)
- Correct handling of split render nodes and vertex buffer compaction  
- Material and shader reconstruction using the official ED shader node types  
- Multi-UV channel support (including baked lightmaps where present)  
- Headless import parity testing against reference `.blend` files generated by the official exporter  

---

## Known Limitations

- **Exact original mesh object names cannot be recovered** from EDM v10 alone.  
  The official exporter strips this information, and reconstructed names rely on importer-side heuristics.
- Quad reconstruction from triangulated EDM geometry is heuristic-based and may not be 100% deterministic.
- Some advanced exporter-side conventions are inferred and may not yet be perfectly matched in all edge cases.
- Bone orientation heuristics are applied to improve visual parity but may differ in rare skeletal setups.

---

## What Is Still In Progress

- Final refinement of quad-merging heuristics for perfect topology parity  
- Edge-case naming consistency for generic Blender object names  
- Further validation against less common EDM feature combinations  
- Continued documentation of EDM format behavior and importer design decisions
